This study integrates the principles of pattern-based classification and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis to identify genes and clinical features associated with the rapid progression of chronic kidney disease. The methodology successfully determines the gene-gene survival interactions in the African-American Study of Chronic Kidney Disease with Hypertension (AASK) genomic dataset. The results obtained from this study serves as a basis for the future studies on comparison of the disease progression in white patients with that in African-American patients, both those with and those without apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) high-risk variants.

In this talk, we will give a summary of the main results in Chapter 1 of "Nonlinear Potential Theory of Degenerate Elliptic Equations" by J. Heinonen, T. Kilpel√§nen, and O. Martio, in which the theory of Weighted Sobolev spaces is developed.
