We consider the problem of interface development and local behavior
of solutions near the interface in the following Cauchy problem for
the nonlinear double degenerate parabolic PDE with reaction:

\[
u_{t}=((u^{m})_{x}\begin{vmatrix}(u^{m})_{x}\end{vmatrix}^{p-1})_{x}-bu^{\beta},
~x\in\mathbb{R},
~t>0;\quad u(x,0)=C(-x)_{+}^{\alpha}
\]
The problem arises in applications involving turbulant filtration
of material through a porous media. The interface behavior is determined
by the competition between the diffusion and the reaction terms. The
full solution for the reaction-diffusion equation ($p=1$) was given
in 2000 [Abdulla and King, SIAM J. Math. Anal., 32, 2(2000), 235-260]
and 2002 [Abdulla, Nonlinear Analysis, 50, 4(2002), 541-560].
Our aim is to apply the methods of these papers to give a full classification
for double degenerate reaction-diffusion equations with ($p>1, mp>1$).
First we apply the nonlinear scaling method to identify which term
dominates in the various regions of the $(\alpha,\beta)$-parameter
space. We then construct super/subsolutions and apply special comparison
theorems in irregular domains to prove explicit formulae for the interface
and local solution, with precise estimations up to constant coefficients.
The theory of double degenerate parabolic PDEs in irregular domains
was developed in this work. A WENO scheme is applied and supports
our estimates.
