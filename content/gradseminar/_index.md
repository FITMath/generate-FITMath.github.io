We prove the short-time asymptotic formula for the interfaces and local solutions near the interfaces for the nonlinear double degenerate reaction-diffusion equation of turbulent filtration with fast diffusion and strong absorption

\[
u_t=\big(|(u^{m})_x|^{p-1}(u^{m})_x\big)_x-bu^{\beta},
\]
with $0 < mp < 1, \, (m, p > 0), \, 0 < \beta < 1, \, b \in \mathbb{R}, \, x \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } t \geq 0$.

Full classification is pursued in terms of the nonlinearity parameters  $m, p,\beta$ and asymptotics of the initial function near its support. In the case of an infinite speed of propagation of the interface, the asymptotic behavior of the local solution is classified at infinity. Similar classification for the slow diffusion case ($mp>1$) was presented in a recent paper

We consider the inverse Stefan type multiphase free boundary problem, in which information on the boundary heat flux is missing, and must be found along with the temperature. We generalize the method developed in

to pursue optimal control framework where control vector consists of the heat flux, and the cost functional is the $L_2$-norm declination of the trace of temperature at the final moment of time to the measured data. We pursue discretization of the problem, and prove convergence of the discrete problem to the original problem with respect to both control and functional.
