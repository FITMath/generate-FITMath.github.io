In this seminar, we will introduce random measures on $\sigma$-compact Hausdorff spaces and define their stochastic integrals of functions of one and two variables.
We further form a rigorous construction of a random measure perturbed by a stochastic process and target its stationary intensity often occurring in control theory.
To obtain that intensity we modify and refine the classic Campbell's theorem for random measures.
Examples of modulated Poisson measures are discussed.

We present a full classification of the short-time behavior of the interfaces and local solutions to the nonlinear double degenerate reaction-diffusion equation of turbulent filtration with strong absorption: 
\[
u_t=\big(|(u^{m})_x|^{p-1}(u^{m})_x\big)_x-bu^{\beta},
\]
with $mp > 1, \, (m, p > 0), \, 0 < \beta < 1, \, b > 0, \, x \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } t \geq 0$. The interface may expand, shrink or remain stationary, as a result of the competition of the diffusion and reaction terms near the interface, expressed in terms of the parameters $m, p,\beta, \text{sign} b$ and asymptotics of the initial function near its support. In all cases we prove explicit formula for the interface and local solution with accuracy up to constant coefficients. The methods of the proof are based on nonlinear scaling laws, and a barrier technique using special comparison theorems in irregular domains with characteristic boundary curves. Numerical analysis using a weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is pursued and comparison of numerical and analytical results is presented.

We pursue numerical analysis of the optimal control problem introduced recently as a variational formulation of the inverse Stefan problem in [U.G.Abdulla, Inverse Problems and Imaging, 7, 2(2013), 307-340 and 10, 4(2016), 869-898]. By employing Frechet differentiability result of the recent paper by [Abdulla et.al., Evolution Equations and Control Theory, 6, 3(2017), 319-344], iterative numerical algorithm based on the projective gradient method in Besov spaces is implemented. We pursue sensitivity analysis with respect to initial guess, and comparison of alternative approaches of simultaneous reconstruction vs. nested optimization of the control vector components. Numerical results are demonstrated for model examples with various levels of complexity.

{{< seminarEntry date="December 04" time="Monday 9:00am" loc="MAC" name="Saleheh Seif" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Breast Cancer Detection via Electrical Impedance Tomography and Optimal Control Theory" >}}

We analyze the inverse problem of breast cancer detection through Electrical Impedance Tomography. EIT is a non-invasive medical imaging method to recover electrical conductivity of the body from electrical measurements on its surface and potentials which are applied to the electrodes such that $\sum U_i=0$. Mathematical formulation of the problem is referred to as Calderon's inverse problem on the identification of the conductivity coefficient of the second order elliptic PDE from additional boundary measurements. We pursue variational formulation and consider the optimal control problem on the minimization of the $L_2$-norm declination of the flux on certain subset of the boundary for thesecond order elliptic PDE.
