{{< seminarEntry date="September 18" time="Monday 9:00am" loc="MAC" name="Adam Prinkey" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Evolution of Interfaces for the Nonlinear Double Degenerate Parabolic Equation of Turbulent Filtration with Absorption" >}}

We present a full classification of the short-time behavior of the interfaces and local solutions to the nonlinear double degenerate reaction-diffusion equation of turbulent filtration with strong absorption: 
\[
u_t=\big(|(u^{m})_x|^{p-1}(u^{m})_x\big)_x-bu^{\beta},
\]
with $mp > 1, \, (m, p > 0), \, 0 < \beta < 1, \, b > 0, \, x \in \mathbb{R}, \text{ and } t \geq 0$. The interface may expand, shrink or remain stationary, as a result of the competition of the diffusion and reaction terms near the interface, expressed in terms of the parameters $m, p,\beta, \text{sign} b$ and asymptotics of the initial function near its support. In all cases we prove explicit formula for the interface and local solution with accuracy up to constant coefficients. The methods of the proof are based on nonlinear scaling laws, and a barrier technique using special comparison theorems in irregular domains with characteristic boundary curves. Numerical analysis using a weighted essentially nonoscillatory (WENO) scheme is pursued and comparison of numerical and analytical results is presented.

We pursue numerical analysis of the optimal control problem introduced recently as a variational formulation of the inverse Stefan problem in [U.G.Abdulla, Inverse Problems and Imaging, 7, 2(2013), 307-340 and 10, 4(2016), 869-898]. By employing Frechet differentiability result of the recent paper by [Abdulla et.al., Evolution Equations and Control Theory, 6, 3(2017), 319-344], iterative numerical algorithm based on the projective gradient method in Besov spaces is implemented. We pursue sensitivity analysis with respect to initial guess, and comparison of alternative approaches of simultaneous reconstruction vs. nested optimization of the control vector components. Numerical results are demonstrated for model examples with various levels of complexity.

{{< seminarEntry date="October 16" time="Monday 9:00am" loc="MAC" name="Ali Al-Obaidi" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Modulated Random Measures On Hausdorff Topological Spaces" >}}

In this seminar, we will introduce random measures on $\sigma$-compact Hausdorff spaces and define their stochastic integrals of functions of one and two variables.
We further form a rigorous construction of a random measure perturbed by a stochastic process and target its stationary intensity often occurring in control theory.
To obtain that intensity we modify and refine the classic Campbell's theorem for random measures.
Examples of modulated Poisson measures are discussed.

{{< seminarEntry date="December 04" time="Monday 9:00am" loc="MAC" name="Saleheh Seif" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Breast Cancer Detection via Electrical Impedance Tomography and Optimal Control Theory" >}}

We analyze the inverse problem of breast cancer detection through Electrical Impedance Tomography. EIT is a non-invasive medical imaging method to recover electrical conductivity of the body from electrical measurements on its surface and potentials which are applied to the electrodes such that $\sum U_i=0$. Mathematical formulation of the problem is referred to as Calderon's inverse problem on the identification of the conductivity coefficient of the second order elliptic PDE from additional boundary measurements. We pursue variational formulation and consider the optimal control problem on the minimization of the $L_2$-norm declination of the flux on certain subset of the boundary for thesecond order elliptic PDE.

{{< seminarEntry date="March 19" time="Monday 9:00am" loc="MAC" name="Adam Prinkey" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Evolution of Interfaces and Explicit Asymptotics at Infinity for the Fast Nonlinear Double Degenerate Parabolic Equation of Turbulent Filtration with Absorption" >}}

We consider the problem of interface development and local behavior
of solutions near the interface in the following Cauchy problem for
the nonlinear double degenerate parabolic PDE with reaction and fast diffusion:

\[
u_{t}= \Big(|(u^{m})_x|^{p-1}(u^{m})_x\Big)_x+bu^{\beta},
\, x\in\mathbb{R}, \, t>0; u(x,0)\sim \, C(-x)_{+}^{\alpha}, \text{ as } x\uparrow 0, \, (u(x,0)=C(-x)_{+}^{\alpha}, \, x\in\mathbb{R}),  \]

with $0< mp <1, \, m, \, p, \, C$, and $\alpha > 0$.
The problem arises in applications involving turbulant filtration
of material through a porous media. The interface behavior is determined
by the competition between the diffusion and the reaction terms. The
full solution for the problem for the reaction-diffusion equation ($p=1$) was given
in 2002 in:

<p>
U. G. Abdulla, Evolution of interfaces and explicit asymptotics at infinity for the fast diffusion equation with absorption, <i>Nonlinear Anal. Theory Methods Appl.</i>, <b>(4) 2002, 541-560</b>.
</p><p>
 
Our aim is to apply the methods of that paper to give a full classification of the interface and the local solution near the interface
for double degenerate reaction-diffusion equations with fast diffusion. Unlike in case of slow diffusion ($mp > 1$), the interface may not exist. If the interface does not exist, we seek to classify the asymptotic behavior of $u(x,t)$ at infinity.
To this end, we first apply a nonlinear scaling technique to identify which term
dominates in the various regions of the $(\alpha,\beta)$-parameter
space. We then construct super/subsolutions and apply special comparison
theorems in irregular domains to prove explicit formulae for the interface (where it exists)
and local solution near the interface, with precise estimations.

We analyze the inverse problem of breast cancer detection through Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT). Inverse EIT problem consists in recovering electrical conductivity field along with electric potential within the body and the boundary voltages for given input currents and contact impedances of the electrodes. We pursue variational formulation and consider the optimal control problem, where electrical conductivity matrix and boundary voltages are control parameters and the minimized cost functional is the quadratic declination of the boundary currents of the corresponding solution of the mixed Neumann-Robin problem for the second order elliptic PDE from given input currents. We prove existence of optimal control and Frechet dierentiability in the Banach space of bounded measurable matrix functions, and derive the optimality condition. The discretization of the optimal control problem through finite differences is implemented and the convergence of the sequence of discrete optimal control problems to continuous optimal control problem is analyzed.
We pursue numerical analysis in a simplied two-dimensional case by implementing projective gradient method in Banach spaces, re-parametrization and space reduction based on principal component analysis, Tikhonov regularization and sensitivity analysis with respect to relative size and locations of cancerous tumors.

We consider the inverse Stefan type free boundary problem for the general second order parabolic PDE under state constraints in the form of the upper bound for the temperature. This problem arises in bioengineering problem about the laser ablation of the skin. We implement optimal control framework following a variational formulation developed in

with penalty functional added due to state constraint. We pursue space-time discretization and prove the convergence of the sequence of discrete optimal control problems to the continuous optimal control both with respect to functional and control. We prove the Frechet differentiability in Besov spaces and derive the formula for the Frechet differential under minimal assumptions on the data.

{{< seminarEntry date="August 27" time="Monday 9:00am" loc="MAC" name="Adam Prinkey" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Analysis of interfaces for the nonlinear double degenerate parabolic equation of turbulent filtration with absorption" >}}

We prove the short-time asymptotic formula for the interfaces and local solutions near the interfaces for the nonlinear double degenerate reaction-diffusion equation of turbulent filtration with fast diffusion and strong absorption
\[ u_t=(|(u^{m})_x|^{p-1}(u^{m})_x)_x-bu^{\beta}; \, u = u(x,t), \, 0<mp<1, \, \beta >0, \, b \in \mathbb{R}. \]
Full classification is pursued in terms of the nonlinearity parameters  $m, p,\beta$ and asymptotics of the initial function near its support. In the case of an infinite speed of propagation of the interface, the asymptotic behavior of the local solution is classified at infinity. Similar classification for the slow diffusion case ($mp>1$) was presented in a recent paper
