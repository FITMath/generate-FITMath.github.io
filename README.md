# generate-fitmath.github.io

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FITMath/generate-FITMath.github.io.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FITMath/generate-FITMath.github.io)

[fitmath.github.io](http://fitmath.github.io) is a static website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) by [Jonathan Goldfarb](https://jgoldfar.github.io/).

Go [here to get hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

This repository hosts the files used to generate fitmath.github.io.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository using git, e.g. from the folder into which you would like FITMath.github.io to appear, run

    git clone git@github.com:FITMath/generate-fitmath.github.io.git

or

    git clone https://github.com/FITMath/generate-fitmath.github.io.git

If you have already cloned the repository, update your working copy using `git pull`.

## Adding & Editing Content

All of the `hugo` templates for the main page content are under `content`.
In particular, material for the main graduate seminar page is under `content/gradseminar/_index.md`; look to the other files under that directory for examples on how to write the necessary macros to make a seminar listing.

Pages are generated using the standard `hugo` commands.
This is automated by calling `make all`.
Calling `make serve` is recommended for rapid iteration on a page; it will run a local server and automatically rebuild the site on changes.
Production files should subsequently be generated by running `make all`.

To add a new file to the page, add it under `content` and use git to add it, e.g.

    git add ...

Once you have made all of your modifications, commit them with a descriptive message and push them to the remote:

    git commit -a -m "commit message"
    git push

## Adding a new Seminar Section

Hugo enables the use of template functions to ensure a consistent and easy editing experience.
The seminars are the main content hosted on this site, and as such, can be generated nearly automatically; look to the files under `gradseminar` for examples on how to do this most easily.
Alternatively, create a new file with the content

```
+++
comments = false
draft = false
tags = [""]
year = ""
semester = ""
title = ""
+++

{{< seminar >}}
{{< seminarEntry date="M D" time="DOW. H-H am" loc="MAC" name="Name" affiliation="Math Sciences Department<br /> Florida Tech" title="Title" >}}
Abstract
{{< /seminarEntry >}}

{{< /seminar >}}
```

Nearly all of the fields above are optional, but highly recommended.
If you want to leave a space for an intentionally empty seminar entry, use notation like

```
{{% seminarEntryEmpty date="October 14, 2014" reason="No talk (Holiday)" %}}
```

## Directory structure

Most of the files in the repository root are generated automatically by `hugo`; in particular, all xml and html files are generated this way.

The main files for editors are as follows:

```
content/ # All templates from which hugo generates content.
layouts/shortcodes/ # codes using Hugo's macro facility to make writing listings easier.
static/ # Files which should be served from the repository root.
themes/FITMathMinimal # Subrepository holding theme & template information.
config.toml # Configuration and parameters for Hugo
```
