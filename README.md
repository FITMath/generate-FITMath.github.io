# fitmath.github.io

[fitmath.github.io](http://fitmath.github.io) is a static website built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io).

Go [here to get hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing).

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository using git, e.g. from the folder into which you would like FITMath.github.io to appear, run

    git clone git@github.com:FITMath/fitmath.github.io.git

or

    git clone https://github.com/FITMath/fitmath.github.io.git

If you have already cloned the repository, update your working copy using `git pull`.

Pages are generated using the standard `hugo` commands, except that they should be generated into the root of the repository from the `gen` subdirectory. This is automated by calling `make all`. Calling `make serve` is recommended for rapid iteration on a page; it will run a local server and automatically rebuild the site on changes. Production files should subsequently be generated by running `make`.

To add a new file to the page, add it under `gen/content` and use git to add it, e.g.

    git add ...

Once you have made all of your modifications, commit them with a descriptive message and push them to the remote:

    git commit -a -m "commit message"
    git push
